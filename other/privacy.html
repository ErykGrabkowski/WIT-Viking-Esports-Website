                            time to time, WIT Vikings Esports may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.WIT Vikings Esports also collects potentially personally-identifying

                            InformationCertain visitors to WIT Vikings Esports's websites choose to interact with WIT Vikings Esports in ways that require WIT Vikings Esports to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
                            that WIT Vikings Esports gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.witvikingesports.com/">https://www.witvikingesports.com</a>&nbsp;to provide
                            a username and email address.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">​</span>3. SecurityThe security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method
